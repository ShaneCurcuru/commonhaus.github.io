Focus on shape and theme/concept, not color. We're trying to narrow it down from 4 concepts to 2 (even better would be 1).

[Additional positioning and sizes](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E4DqWuQGkborPXXWfwGJgVgf2N--V94HacFsptEbKFA) 

We'll narrow the poll question: 

1. Choose your favorite concept (row: A, B, C, D).
2. (üöÄ, optional) Specific number if you have a favorite
3. (üëé, optional) Specific number if it is an absolute no

Constructive comments help. 

We can further explore a concept once we narrow to a favorite (and if we haven't otherwise picked a winner).
