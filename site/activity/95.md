### Consensus mechanism

<!--vote::manual -->
Rank them in order of preference.

- (ðŸš€, optional) Specific number if you have a favorite
- (ðŸ‘Ž, optional) Specific number if it is an absolute no

Constructive commentary is helpful.

If you have other suggestions, try to put together a full palette to demonstrate.
