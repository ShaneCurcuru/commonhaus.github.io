The Commonhaus Foundation is dedicated to supporting the growth and stability of open-source projects through collaboration and innovation. Inspired by our foundational principles, we create a home for projects and communities.

## Our Guiding Principles

- **Honor project and community identity**

    We respect the unique identity of each project and its community, ensuring they retain their character and autonomy within the broader open-source ecosystem. Celebrating diversity and individuality, we empower projects to continue their development under their own vision and leadership.

- **Offer guidance and support instead of imposing mandates**

    Our role is to provide support and guidance, facilitating project growth without overbearing governance. By offering resources, connections, and expertise, we help projects navigate challenges while ensuring they remain in control of their path.

- **Maintain transparency in all of our actions**

    Transparency is key to building trust and fostering an open environment. We commit to clear communication, open decision-making processes, and accessible documentation, ensuring our actions and intentions are always visible to our community.

- **Encourage long-term thinking for sustained project impact**

    We advocate for forward-looking strategies that ensure projects are not just successful today but continue to thrive and evolve. Through succession planning, mentorship, and strategic guidance, we support projects in building a legacy that lasts.

By embodying these principles, the Commonhaus Foundation aims to provide a nurturing home for open-source projects, where innovation is celebrated, collaboration is encouraged, and long-term success is achieved.

## Our Mission
